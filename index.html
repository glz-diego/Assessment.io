		&emsp;&emsp;In November 24th, I was born in Torreon, Coahuila, Mexico, to Ana and Aniceto. I grew up with two siblings, my sister, Paola, who is 6 years older than me, and my brother, Daniel, who is 10 years older than me. I grew up living in the house next to my grandparent's, where our family would meet every Sunday. As I grew up, I was always in a private bilingual school, so ever since I was little I had been studying English. In Mexico I always always in the top 5 in my class, granted that was a small class but still. I was always intrested in engineering, in building, designing, I would always disassemble my toys one way or another, but I did never figure out how to put them back.

		&emsp;&emsp;By age eight, my brother moved to Mexico city to go to college. A year later, the rest of my family and me moved to the U.S. I was overwhelmed with the English, for while I knew the words and most of the language, I had never practiced it. As school went by, English got easier, and before I knew it, I was in middle school. Over the course of middle school, I took a TechApps class, letting me learn the basics of Photoshop, and HTML. I also took a Gateway class that helped me get in the mindset of an engineer, studying machanical engineer or programming, that class had it all. During middle school I also performed in the school musical, Shrek, as the Big Bad Wolf, and loved it. In middle school, I also found out over time that while my family was Catholic, I was an atheist. After the shock of my being an Atheist shook my parents a little, they either became really understanding, or just deny the whole thing and just don't talk about it.

		&emsp;&emsp;Freshman year! High School! While it seemed mortifying before it started, high school is actually really fun. I love my classes, including Introduction to Engineering Design, and Computer Science I, in which I have studied scratch, Alice, Jeroo, and am currently working in JCreator.
